# Virtually Hired: ichack25

## About

This is a web app built in flask that promises to help you practice for one way interviews, assisted with ai.

We provide a HireVue style environment to practice questions from a databank (allowing you to add more yourself) and to have your responses and video presentation be graded by AI, to then be presented in an easy to understand format that helps you to understand your strengths and weaknesses.

We also provide various accessibility features such as screen reader support, dylexia fonts and various colour schemes.
